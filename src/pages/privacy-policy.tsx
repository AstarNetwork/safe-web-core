          However, if we combine or connect aggregated data with your personal data so that it can directly or
          indirectly identify you, we treat the combined data as personal data which will be used in accordance with
          this Privacy Policy.

              Request us to delete any personal data we have about you – this enables you to ask us to delete or remove
              personal data where there is no good reason for us continuing to process it. You also have the right to
              ask us to delete or remove your personal data where you have successfully exercised your right to object

            <li>
              Object to processing of your personal data – where we are relying on a legitimate interest (or those of a
              third party) and there is something about your particular situation which makes you want to object to
              processing on this ground as you feel it impacts on your fundamental rights and freedoms. You also have
              the right to object where we are processing your personal data for direct marketing purposes. In some

            </li>
            <li>
              Request restriction of processing your personal data – this enables you to ask us to suspend the

                Request transfer of your personal data to you or to a third party – we will provide to you, or a third
                party you have chosen, your personal data in a structured, commonly used, machine-readable format. Note
                that this right only applies to automated information which you initially provided consent for us to use
                or where we used the information to perform a contract with you.

                Right to withdraw consent at any time – in the rare circumstances where we ask for your consent to
                process your personal data, any consent is provided freely and if you decide to withdraw you consent,
                this will not affect the lawfulness of any processing carried out before you withdraw your consent. If
                you withdraw your consent, we may not be able to provide certain services to you. We will advise you if
                this is the case at the time you withdraw your consent.

            If you wish to exercise any of the rights set out above, please contact us at admin@stake.co.jp You will not
            have to pay a fee to access your personal data (or to exercise any of the other rights). However, we may
            charge a reasonable fee if your request is clearly unfounded, repetitive or excessive. Alternatively, we
            could refuse to comply with your request in these circumstances. We may need to request specific information
            from you to help us confirm your identity and ensure your right to access your personal data (or to exercise
            any of your other rights). This is a security measure to ensure that personal data is not disclosed to any
            person who has no right to receive it. We may also contact you to ask you for further information in
            relation to your request to speed up our response.
          </p>
          <p>
            We try to respond to all legitimate requests within one month. Occasionally it could take us longer than a
            month if your request is particularly complex or you have made a number of requests. In this case, we will
            notify you and keep you updated.
